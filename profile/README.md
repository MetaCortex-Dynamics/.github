# MetaCortex Dynamics
### Where minds build the next minds.

MetaCortex Dynamics develops self-governing intelligence architectures:
systems that can reason, adapt, recover, and evolve under
invariant-preserving constraints.

## Core projects
- **Devon OS** — cognitive operating system with advanced governance,
  recovery ladders, and full transactional logging.
- **Cortex / META** — safety, identity, and meta-governance layers for
  autonomous systems.
- **MEAVM / Tenzra** — forthcoming econophysics and strategic cognition frameworks.

**Start here:** the Devon OS demo repository.
