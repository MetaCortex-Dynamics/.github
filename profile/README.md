# MetaCortex Dynamics
### Where minds build the next minds.

MetaCortex Dynamics develops self-governing intelligence architectures
focused on safety, identity, and long-horizon system integrity.

## Core projects

- **Devon OS** — a cognitive operating system exploring governed autonomy,
  auditability, and identity persistence in complex systems.

- **Cortex / META** — safety, identity, and meta-governance layers for
  autonomous and semi-autonomous agents.

- **MEAVM / Tenzra** — forthcoming work on econophysics and strategic
  cognition frameworks.

**Start here:** the Devon OS repository (architecture and research materials).
